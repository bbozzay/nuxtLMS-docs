```loginThenRedirect()```
Adds an encoded param to the login url containing the state. When the login is successful, the callback url will reload with the encoded state. By default, a redirectUrl is passed to the state. Middleware decodes the state param and then redirects to the specified route.

```redirectFromState()```
Redirects to the redirectUrl specified in the encoded state param generated by `loginThenRedirect()`.


```getAppMeta()```
Returns the app_metadata for the user.
